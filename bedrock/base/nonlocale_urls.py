"""URL paths which must be prefixed with a language code.

These are included in the main URLConf via the regular `patterns` function,
which will mean they are NOT prefixed with a language code.

Note that these are derived from the list of SUPPORTED_NONLOCALES and
SUPPORTED_LOCALE_IGNORE that were used in our former i18n machinery, and
which (currently) remain in use, so these two sources need to be kept in
sync with the urlpatterns below
