    <h2 id="information-shared-with-us-and-other-participants">
      Information Shared With Us and Other Participants
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Account information:</strong> You will need a Mozilla account to purchase a Hubs Subscription.
      However, a user does not need an account to use Hubs. Certain features (like storing your avatar),
      require an account. You can create an account through Hubs or through Discord. If you create an account
      with your email address, we store a hashed version of your email address. If you create an account
      through Discord, we receive the email address associated with your Discord account and your Discord
      avatar.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Room names and URLs:</strong> Rooms and room names are publicly accessible to anyone with the URL.
      Mozilla stores the name and the URL for the link you share so you and others with the link to the Room
      can use it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Avatar data:</strong> Your selected avatar and name will be shared with other participants in your
      rooms and the host of your Hubs instance. If you’re logged in to your account, we will store your avatar.
      If you’re not logged into your account, we will not store your avatar.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Voice data:</strong> If your microphone is on, Hubs sends the audio to other users in the room.
      Mozilla does not store the audio; we only receive it temporarily to transmit it to others in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Chat:</strong> If you send messages in Hubs, Hubs shares it with the other users in the room.
      Mozilla does not store chats; we only receive it temporarily to transmit it to others in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Photos and Videos You Take, and Photos, Videos, and Objects You Upload:</strong> If you take photos
      and video in a Hubs room or upload photos, videos, or objects to a room, Mozilla stores them so you can
      share them within the room. They are deleted within 72 hours unless you pin them. If you pin them they
      will be stored until you remove them from the room and they will be viewable by anyone who can access the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can learn more by looking at the code itself: <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/hubs">Hubs</a>
      (the front-end) <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/dialog/">Dialog</a> (the webRTC server),
      <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/reticulum">Reticulum</a> (the backend web server),
      <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/hubs-ops">Hubs-Ops</a> (the infrastructure code),
      <a href="https://github.com/MozillaReality/hubs-discord-bot">Discord Bot</a> (enables users to connect
      their Discord community to Hubs).

    <h2 id="other-information-we-receive">
      Other Information We Receive
    </h2>
    <p>
      We use technical, interaction, error, and website analytics data to help us improve the Hubs experiences:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Technical data:</strong> We receive data about the type of devices used to interact with Hubs, as
      well as their operating systems, languages, the names and versions of browsers, and other data needed to
      load and operate a room.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Interaction data:</strong> We receive data about interactions with Hubs, such as the number of rooms
      created, messages sent through or to third-party services like Discord (including aggregated counts such as
      the number of messages and users who have joined relevant channels), the number of users in a particular room,
      the start and end time of users’ interactions with Hubs, the amount of time users interact with Hubs through
      virtual reality, the first time in a particular month or day that a user begins to use Hubs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Error Data:</strong> When Hubs crashes or fails, Mozilla receives error messages which may include the
      room URL, response time for requests, the page a user was on when the error happened, the user’s operating
      system, browser information, and IP address.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Website Analytics Data:</strong> We use Google Analytics (GA) to better understand how people interact
      with Hubs. For example, we collect de-identified information about the number of Hubs rooms created or entered,
      interactions with buttons and menus, session length, user location (country, state/province, and city), language
      settings, browser type and version, viewport size, and screen resolution. You can opt-out of GA data collection
      by installing the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>.

    <h2 id="information-we-collect-for-published-scenes-and-custom-avatars">
      Information We Collect for Published Scenes and Custom Avatars
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Scenes and avatars you create:</strong> Mozilla stores scenes and avatars that users create so we can
      display them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Attribution information:</strong> When someone publishes a scene or avatar to Hubs, they have the option
      to “Allow Remixing with Creative Commons <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC-BY 3.0</a>” or
      “allow Mozilla to promote your scene or avatar”. If the user chooses one or both of these options, Mozilla will
      share the scene or avatar and attribution information publicly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Account information:</strong> To publish a scene or avatar to Hubs, a user must have a Hubs account. Mozilla
      will receive and store a hashed version of their email address to allow them to log in and view their 3D Room models
      and Avatars.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2 id="information-we-collect-about-your-subscription">
      Information We Collect about Your Subscription
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Mozilla account information.</strong> A Hubs subscription requires a Mozilla account, which sends Mozilla your
      email address, locale, and IP address. Learn more about
      <a href="{{ url('privacy.notices.firefox') }}#firefox-accounts-join-firefox">Mozilla account data practices</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Location information.</strong> Mozilla receives your IP address from your Mozilla account when you sign up for
      and use the service. We use the IP address in order to approximate your location because Mozilla VPN is currently
      only available in certain countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Payment information.</strong> When you subscribe to the Services, you will send payment through one of our
      third-party payment providers: Stripe, Apple, PayPal, or Google Pay. Mozilla receives a record of your account
      (including your billing address and the last four digits of your payment method) and the status of your account’s
      subscription, but does not store your full payment details. The payment providers may also collect personal
      transactional data or device information via cookies and similar technologies to operate and improve their service.
      You can learn more about how these companies use and process your data by reviewing their Privacy Notices, which
      are available on each of their respective websites.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Usage information.</strong> We receive information about the rooms and users in your Hubs instance. For
      instance, we learn when you create and delete rooms, how many rooms are in your Hubs instance, and how many users
      are in each room. We also receive information about how much storage space your Hubs instance is using.
    </p>

      leave with the connected Discord channel. Hubs does not log any synchronized messages. You can see
